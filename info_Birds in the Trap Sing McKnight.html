                Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight (BITTSM) is Travis Scott’s sophomore studio album
                and follow-up to Rodeo. It was released on September 2nd, 2016.
                Travis dedicated the title of the album to his friends in Missouri City, Texas,
                who feel they are stuck in a societal trap.
                Speaking on the album’s title to Billboard, Scott said,
                It all stemmed from me having that frustration of just like wanting to do creative s–t and
                just not being able to do it. It took five months for my action figure to come out. It took
                eight months for the Hype Williams video to come out. I just felt like I was confined in a box.
                I couldn’t do s–t I wanted to do to help forward pop culture and music. It’s like motherf–kers still tryna
                hold me back so that was the whole gist of it. “In the trap” has nothing to do with coke or anything. It’s literally a trap…
                [and] Nothing to do with Brian McKnight but the title came from me, Quavo and Young Thug working on “Pick Up The Phone.” Young
                Quavius was rapping, bouncing off ideas, and I was letting him know the story and the vibe of my album so when he was doing his verse,
                dude just says “Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight.” I ran in the booth and I was like, “Bro, this is it!” [Laughs]</p>
